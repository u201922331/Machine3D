    Parameters
    ---------- 
    k : int
        Number of neighbors that will be used to compute the filter.                                  
    r : float
        The radius of the sphere with center on each point. The filter
        will look for the required number of neighboors inside that sphere.    
        
    Notes
    -----          
    > The distances between each point and his 'k' nearest neighbors that 
        exceed the given 'r' are marked as False.
    
    > The points having any distance marked as False will be trimmed.
    
    The parameter r should be used in order to adjust the filter to
    the desired result.
            
    A LOWER 'r' value will result in a HIGHER number of points trimmed.

    """ Compute a Statistical Outlier Removal filter using the Neighbourhood.

    Parameters
    ---------- 
    k : int
        Number of neighbors that will be used to compute the filter. 
    z_max: float
        The maximum Z score wich determines if the point is an outlier.
        
    Notes
    -----                
    > For each point, the mean of the distances between him and his 'k' nearest 
        neighbors is computed.
    
    > The Z score of those means is computed.
    
    >  Points where the Z score is less than or more than 'z_max' are marked
